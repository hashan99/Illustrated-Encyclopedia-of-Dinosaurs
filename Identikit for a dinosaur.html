	 <P><FONT SIZE=6>Identifying a dinosaur is the job of a palaeontologist - a scientist who studies the fossilized remains of both animal and plant life. To start to identify any 
        dinosaur, palaeontologists usually have just a pile of bones - fossilized bones, which millions of years ago were encased by layers of sand and mud. These layers solidified 
        until they formed rocks, transforming the dinosaur bones into rocks, too.</P>
		
	 <P>Occasionally, a whole skeleton may be found - to unearth a dinosaur skeleton which has remained intact is the dream of every palaeontologist, but this is very rare.
        This is why they have to be able to recognize every single bone looks like, and where it belongs in the whole skeleton.</FONT> </P>

	 <P><FONT SIZE=6>The fossils of prehistoric animals have always fascinated people, and this has led to many stories about them. Around 600 BC, tribes of merchants who were 
	    travelling from central Asia to Greece had to cross the Gobi Desert. As they made their journeys, they told stories and legends of prehistoric monsters, of animals with 
		the bodies of lions and the heads of eagles which guarded the treasures hidden in the dessert.</P>
		
	 <P>These mythical animals were called grypons, and they were probably based on the fossilized skeletons of the <I><U>Protoceratops</U></I>, a species of small horned 
	    dinosaur. The first report on dinosaur remains were written about 1700 years ago. These were chinese manuscripts which gave details of fossilized bones, quoted as  
		being'the bones of a dragon'. To help us progress from stories about dragons to facts on dinosaurs, we have bones, teeth, footprints, impressions of skin...and, like 
        a detective, a palaeontologist finds out how to re - construct the skeleton of a dinosaurs, so that we can learn what it looked like and how it moved. But first, there
        are many mysteries to investigate and puzzles to solve...</FONT></P>

	 <P><FONT SIZE=6>Until quite recently, dinosaurs were generally considered to be a subgroup of the reptile class. But, recent discoveries have made palaeontologists doubt this 
	    and many are still not convinced. What has to be clarified now is the relationship between dinisaurs and reptiles. To do this, palaeontologists need to examine how both 
		developed and evolved, to see if there is any possible link on the basis of bodily characteristics which they have in common.</FONT></P>

	 <P><FONT SIZE=6> Dinosaurs are classified as vertebrates - because, like all vertibrates, a dinosaur had an internal skeleton supported by a vertibral column (or spine). 
	 The class of vertebrates comprises fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammels. At present, dinosaurs are classed as reptiles. However, as more fossilized remains come to 
	 light, this classification will be re-examined in future years. As a matter of fact, dinosaurs differ from reptiles in many ways, the most significant difference being with regard to 
	 the bones in the feet, in the legs and in the hips.</P> 
	 
	 <P>A reptile moves along keeping its legs bent and sticking out at either side of its body. As it moves, its stomach just grazes the ground, and its spine moves from right to left, 
      left to right, its claws completing the whole, wide semi-circular movement. A crocodile can lift its body a little and run along, but only for short periods. Some reptiles, 
	  such as the basilisk, are able to run using only there hind legs, but most reptiles move on all fours, their legs at either side of the body.</P>
	  
	 <P>On the other hand, the legs of a dinosaur were straight and underneath its body (like a dog or a cow) and its stomach did not touch the ground as it ran along. In common 
	 with birds, dinosaurs had 'digits' (finger-like claws). A dinosaur did not put its whole foot on the ground, only the claw. The pelvis, which comprised the ilium, ischium 
	 and pubis, was very strong and fused to the sacral (rear back) vertebrae to give it added strength. This structure of the legs and the pelvis is found in many groups of 
	 biped dinosaurs (those walking only on their hind legs).</FONT></P>
